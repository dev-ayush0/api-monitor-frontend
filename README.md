# API Monitor Frontend

This is the frontend for a simple SaaS dashboard that monitors API uptime and performance in plain English, built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and deployed on Vercel. It connects to a Supabase backend to track API endpoints and display their status.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed.
- A Supabase project set up (see backend repo for details).

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dev-ayush0/api-monitor-frontend.git
   cd api-monitor-frontend
